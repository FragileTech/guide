### Basic concepts

### What is Git?
A fundamental key in collaborative projects is having control (or a tracking history) over the 
modifications made on the project. Git is a popular distributed version control system broadly 
used in software development.

Git facilitates the addition of novel content through the use of _branches_, 
bifurcations in the tracking history of the project that allows the creation 
(or update) of extra features in a secure, fully controlled sandbox. 

Each project has a default branch (usually named `master` or `main`) that act as the source of truth 
for the project's code. We develop new features in different branches, and we integrate them into the default branch
after a review process.

#### What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
<!---Naming conventions in programming languages is anything but clear. While HTML and CSS describe what the code is about, others like C++ are named after its origin. We have also the case of Java and JavaScript,  -->
As mentioned, Git is a popular _Version Control System_ used to manage a wide variety of projects. Git is installed and maintain in your local machine, and it keeps a record of your programming versions. What makes Git unique from the rest of its competitors is its branching model, which allows you to test and try new ideas without touching the main line. 

Having said that, what is GitHub's role? _GitHub_ is a Git repository hosting service. It is a cloud-based database where people can track and share with other developers their local Git repositories. Unlike Git, GitHub presents a graphical user interface to administer your projects using its built-in control tools. 

Being interesting utilities separately, the real collaborative environment boosts when Git and GitHub work together. You can share your projects through GitHub, giving your teammates the opportunity to review and comment on your additions. As the project evolves, new branches are created to introduce new changes, allowing the group to work on distinct features without overwriting each other's work during the process. This philosophy promotes coordination among comrades, making possible a collaborative development process.

### Basic concepts

### What is Git?
A fundamental key in collaborative projects is having control (or a tracking history) over the 
modifications made on the project. Git is a popular distributed version control system broadly 
used in software development.

Git facilitates the addition of novel content through the use of _branches_, 
bifurcations in the tracking history of the project that allows the creation 
(or update) of extra features in a secure, fully controlled sandbox. 

Each project has a default branch (usually named `master` or `main`) that act as the source of truth 
for the project's code. We develop new features in different branches, and we integrate them into the default branch
after a review process.
